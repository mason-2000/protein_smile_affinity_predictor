# protein_smile_affinity_predictor
The project investigates how weighting chemical properties relative to molecular and protein embeddings affects protein–ligand affinity prediction. An ElasticNet regression with cross-validation is used to evaluate the optimal weighting factor and model performance in terms of RMSD.
